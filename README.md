We are trying to replace the motherboards of Amazon echo devices with generic technology like an ESP32 to make them natively compatible with open source home automation like home assistant and rhasspy.
In an ideal situation, we would like to have the same design for any devices, with only the form factor of the board itself adaptating to the Amazon device.

We would like to reuse the maximum of components already in the echo devices to avoid electronic waste (wall plug with power jack, daughter boards with mics arrays, speakers, ...)

The design file are EasyEDA format, don't hesitate to share your pro and cons about it, we are very open to make our workflow evolve.
